# CMPE 272 Enterprise Software Platform Project

## Overview
Deployed at: https://majestic-syrniki-4d8693.netlify.app/login
The project involves the creation of a website that serves as both a presentation platform and a dashboard for an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) anomaly detection system.

## Project Components

1. **Dashboard in Tableau:**
   - The core of the project is a dashboard built using Tableau. This dashboard is designed to display basic visualizations related to an HVAC anomaly detection system. It provides insights into various parameters such as temperature, humidity, runtimes, and error logs.

2. **Website:**
   - The website serves as a user interface to access and interact with the Tableau dashboard. Users can log in using the provided credentials to view the dashboard's content.

## Login Credentials

To access the website and view the dashboard, users can use the following credentials:

- **Email:** hvac.owner@gmail.com
- **Password:** hvac

## Dashboard Visualizations

The Tableau dashboard showcases sample data visualizations to aid in the detection of HVAC issues. The visualizations include:

- **Temperature:** Graphical representation of temperature variations.
- **Humidity:** Visualizations related to humidity levels.
- **Runtimes:** Displaying the operational runtimes of the HVAC system.
- **Error Logs:** Visualizing error logs to identify and address potential issues.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of Tableau for creating an HVAC anomaly detection dashboard accessible through a user-friendly website. It serves as a practical application of enterprise software platform concepts learned in the CMPE 272 course. The provided credentials allow users to explore the dashboard's functionalities and gain insights into HVAC system performance.
